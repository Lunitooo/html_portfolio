<h3> Captain Fantastic</h3>
<h4>5 of 5 Stars</h4> 
    This is a uncommon movie, very strange to hear. <br />
    I think it has his magic from the argument that we don't have to <br />
    grow up and be educated in the traditional way, instead we can be <br />
    educated paying more attention to the natural stuffs. <br />
    We have so much to learn from the nature, the forrests and the world <br />
